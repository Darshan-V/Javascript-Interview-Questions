# REST

### what is REST?

1. Rest stands for representational state transfer. It is an architectural style for developing web services.
2. In REST full architecture data is represented as resource and client interacts with the resources with HTTP reeequests.

### What is REST-API?

1. A REST API is an interface that provides endpoints in REST architectural style for clients to interact with using HTTP for accessing the resources they allow.

### what are REST principles?

1. client-server architecture:
   Seperating the user interface concerns from data storage concerns.
2. statelessness: A server
3. cacheability: the server should indicate whether the responses could be cashed by the client or not
4. layered system: a layered architecture allows other intermediaries like load balancers, proxies, gateways to be inserted between client and server
5. uniform interface: Resources should be identified by a unique identifier(URI) with HTTP methods.
